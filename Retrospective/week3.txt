Retrospective for week 3:
What went well for this past week and up until now is the refactoring into the react router code base which allows for a cleaner look and functionality of the code. We have also been able to communicate very well amongst our team in and outside of meetings. What isn’t up to our wishes were the demo and how we weren’t able to show what we thought we had working. We also were not able to get some of the functionalities from the previous week. What we have to do this week is finish up those last little functionalities from last week and finish the infrastructure to allow the course to be recorded and edited. Another thing we have to focus on this week is deploying to AWS and writing test cases for our code we write so we know it’s working. Finally, we hope to create a video to show as a demo to fix any issues with demoing errors.
