# Final Speedgolf App
This code base starts with the MERN stack MVP implmentation of the speedgolf
app as it was deployed to MongoDB Atlas and AWS EB in Chapter 24. To that it adds
some key features that were included as end-of-chapter exercises:

* Ability to delete a speedgolf round
* Ability to edit and delete a user account

This repo serves as the starting code for all of the CptS 489 project teams in the
Fa20 semester. It will be pushed to their repos, deployed to their instances on
AWS EB, and served through https://[proj-name].bfapp.org

The app can be launched to http://localhost:8081 through the command
npm run dev.
